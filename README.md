## Installation

### BIOS Settings

You have to disable a lot of things, especially "Secure Boot".

### Creating the USB Installer

You will need a 16+ GB USB, a Mac and an internet connection to download the Mojave Installer.
Open the App Store, search for "Mojave", download it.

While it's downloading, use Disk Utility to format your USB Drive as Mac OS X Extended (Journaled) and rename your USB stick to "USB" (just to be easier). Don't forget to change before the partition table to `GPT` when formatting the USB Stick. Every USB comes with `MBR` partition by default because it's the most compatible one for external medias. But we want a `GPT` partition. So in Disk Utility, enable the "Show All Devices Option" in the menu (it's in the "Presentation" or "View" menu). Select your USB Stick and erase the whole USB with `GPT` option selected.

Once the download is done, open the Terminal and write:

```bash
sudo "/Applications/Install macOS Mojave.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia" --volume /Volumes/USB
```

It will copy the installer to your USB Stick and make it bootable. It can take some time.

### Install Clover on the USB Installer

Once we have a USB Installer, we need to install Clover on it, with our `config.plist` file and the needed kexts for our laptop. Here are the steps:

* Download Clover **r5093**: https://github.com/Dids/clover-builder/releases/tag/v2.5k_r5093
* Start the Clover-Minimal installation app
* Make sure to select your USB Stick as the destination during the installation. We also want to Customize the installation so click on "Customize"
* Check these items in the customize list:
    - Install for UEFI booting only
    - Install Clover in the ESP
    - drivers/UEFI/AppleUiSupport
    - drivers/UEFI/SMCHelper-64
    - drivers/UEFI/ApfsDriverLoader
    - drivers/UEFI/AptioMemoryFix
    - drivers/UEFI/HFSPlus
    - drivers/UEFI/AppleGenericInput


### Copy my EFI Folder

Download my EFI Folder from this repo and copy it (replace, not merge) to your USB Installer existing EFI Folder in the EFI Partition. It will replace your EFI folder that was created by Clover during the installation, copy all the necessary kext files and my `config.plist` file as well.

**Note:** I use the [Clover-Minimal Theme](https://github.com/al3xtjames/clover-theme-minimal) in my `config.plist` so if you only download my `config.plist`, be sure to either install this theme or change it to something you already have.

## macOS Mojave Installation

Reboot your Laptop with the USB Installer stick plugged in. Press `ESC`, choose `Boot Menu (F9)` and pick your USB Stick, it should boot to Clover. Pick your USB Installer in the menu, the Mojave Installer will start to load. You can encounter various graphics glitches during this step, it's fine.

HP have begun shipping these laptops with Samsung PM981 SSDs, which can cause kernel panicks on boot and during the macOS installer. To fix this, the `NVMEFix.kext` was added in this config.

Once you reach the Mojave Installer, launch the Disk Utility app and in the menubar, in the "presentation" menu (or similar, don't remember the name), enable "Show all devices". That way, we will see our internal hard drive completely in Disk Utility. Format it as Mac OS X Extended (Journaled) and pick the scheme "GUID Partition Map" or similar.

Now close the Disk Utility and start the Installer.

## Post-Installation

You should now have a running Hackintosh. After reaching the Desktop, the first thing to do is to install Clover but this time on your Laptop HDD (right now we were able to boot thanks to the USB Installer and Clover on it).

Basically redo all the same steps described before : Install Clover, pick this time your Laptop HDD as destination, same customize settings. Then copy my EFI Folder to the Laptop's HDD EFI.

### Generate your serials

By default, my `config.plist` file doesn't contain any serial. You need to generate yours. You can use [macserial](https://github.com/acidanthera/macserial) to generate serials for the model we picked (MacBookPro14,1). To do that, download macserial, open the Terminal, go to the folder that contains macserial (`cd /folder/that/contains/macserial`) and run:

`./macserial -a | grep -i 'MacBookPro14,1'`

It will output some table with the following structure "Product | Serial | Board Serial (MLB)". Add the serial and the Board Serial to your `config.plist` with any text editor or with Clover Configurator and save it. Now you should be able to boot without your USB Installer plugged-in.

### Internet

You can use the LAN/Ethernet port which works OOTB. For the WIFI, you have three options:

* You can replace the internal card with a compatible one. You can find plenty of them on eBay. 
* You can use a USB Dongle WIFI. I own a cheap [TP-Link-TL-WN725N](https://www.tp-link.com/us/home-networking/usb-adapter/tl-wn725n/) and it worked great. Once you have plugged it in one of your USB ports, install the drivers. You can find them for Mojave here: https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/download/tl-wn725n/#Driver. Reboot, done.
* **NEW** ðŸ”¥: Some [talented developers](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless) created kexts from Linux code to support Intel WIFI and Bluetooth Out Of The Box on macOS! This is the approach I now use and it works great! I can connect to 5Ghz WIFI Networks without any USB Dongle and Bluetooth works also with my phone. For the WIFI, you have to install the app [Heliport](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/HeliPort) that replicates macOS Wifi interface to select network etc. The 3 kexts for Wifi & Bluetooth are provided in my EFI already. This is an alpha release so some bugs might occur.

### HIDPI / Retina Resolution

You can enable retina options with this FHD monitor by using this script: https://github.com/xzhih/one-key-hidpi. 

Staying at 1920x1080 resolution on this laptop is quite hard because the text is too small to my taste. After applying this script, I use the retina resolution of 1680x944 @ 120 Hz which is a good compromise between space and crispy font.

**Note:** I have a 120 Hz panel, your model most likely doesn't have it unless you bought your laptop with this option. Therefore, don't try to run it with this refresh rate, you are stuck at 60 Hz.

### Dock

I was able to use this laptop with a [HP USB-C Universal Dock](https://store.hp.com/us/en/pdp/hp-usb-c-universal-dock) connected to the Thunderbolt 3 port. What works:

* Ethernet
* USB 2 ports
* USB 3 ports
* 1 displayPort
* Recharging the laptop
* Audio output

To use the DisplayPort outputs, I had to install the DisplayLink Drivers for Mojave. You can find them here: https://www.displaylink.com/downloads/file?id=1367.

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to run two displayport monitors from the dock. Only one seems to work. 

**Workaround:** Use one external monitor with the built-in HDMI output and another one with the 1 displayport from the dock. I have then 3 screens (internal screen + 2 external monitors)!

If you still struggle to make your Docking station work, please have a look at these two repos:

* Thunderbolt 3 Unblocker : https://github.com/rgov/Thunderbolt3Unblocker
* macOS IOElectrify : https://github.com/the-darkvoid/macOS-IOElectrify

And try to install them on your own.

## Future & Catalina

As I use this laptop for work and everything is running almost fine, I don't plan for now to update to Catalina for these reasons and some others. I use some work-applications that work perfectly on Mojave and are not supported yet on 10.15. I can't take the risk of breaking something important.

Nevertheless, if you're willing to install Catalina on this machine, you can try my EFI (which seems to work with minor changes) or the future-proof OpenCore alternative made by [kecinzer](https://github.com/kecinzer) which seems to run really well too.
